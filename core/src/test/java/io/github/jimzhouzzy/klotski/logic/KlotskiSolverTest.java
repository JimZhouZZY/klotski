     * - Valid input with known expected solutions
     * - Edge cases including minimal or boundary inputs
     * - Invalid input that should trigger appropriate exceptions or error handling
     * The test uses assertions to validate that the solution matches the expected result, checks for
     * proper exception types when invalid input is provided, and confirms error messages are accurate.
